## Changes on the assignment 

>### Adding ALT Atributte

I realized on the existing code we did not have "Alt" on the images so we added in the 6 images along the code. 

>### Regrouping classes

Classes that had the same attributes were localized in the original code to unify them into one and not have the same attributes in different classes

>### Name changed 

Is more proffesional when you open the page in your browser shows the name of the company.
